  <h2>Main City: Havenport</h2>
  <p><em>A modern coastal city, alive with sparkle and opportunity.</em></p>
  <p>
    Havenport is the central hub of Ruby’s stories—a vibrant, upscale city where glittering skyscrapers meet cozy neighborhoods.  
    It’s here that billionaires live in glass-walled penthouses, heroines sip lattes in tucked-away cafés, and love stories unfold under the city lights.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Seaview Heights:</strong> Towering luxury high-rises with sweeping ocean views. Perfect for rooftop romance—or for Ruby to prowl a billionaire’s penthouse.</li>
    <li><strong>Maplewood District:</strong> A charming residential area with leafy streets, local coffee shops, and the heroine’s apartment. Homey, warm, and perfect for everyday romance.</li>
    <li><strong>The Galleria:</strong> Upscale shopping, glittering art galleries, and candlelit restaurants. Ideal for meet-cutes and unforgettable first dates.</li>
    <li><strong>Riverside Park:</strong> A green escape in the heart of the city, perfect for afternoon strolls, surprise picnics, and impromptu cat adventures.</li>
    <li><strong>Havenport Marina:</strong> Sparkling waters and yacht parties, where secrets are shared under the stars and weekend escapes begin.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Secondary City: Crestbridge</h2>
  <p><em>A quieter counterpart to Havenport—just far enough away to spark tension.</em></p>
  <p>
    Crestbridge is only a short drive away, but its leafy streets and historic downtown feel like another world.  
    Here, romance is softer, more intimate—perfect for quiet escapes, unexpected encounters, and the kind of misunderstandings that keep hearts racing.
  </p>

  <h2>Other Locations</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Eastmont Airport:</strong> Where emotional departures, grand reunions, and daring “chase scenes” happen.</li>
    <li><strong>Silverwood Hills:</strong> Rolling countryside estates, lavish parties, and secret weekend getaways.</li>
    <li><strong>Local University:</strong> A lively campus that adds friendships, sports drama, and social sparks to Ruby’s world.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Wherever Ruby goes—whether slipping onto a yacht, wandering through a park, or curling up in a penthouse window—she brings a touch of magic, mischief, and matchmaking charm.
