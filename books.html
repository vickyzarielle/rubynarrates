    <p><b>A billionaire CEO. A marketing exec with no time for distractions. And one sassy cat determined to cause chaos...</b></p>
    <p>Nolan Pierce is powerful, polished and far too serious for his own good. The rules of his empire are simple: no distractions, no complications, no mixing business with pleasure. But Emma’s quick wit and gentle warmth prove harder to ignore than any boardroom negotiation.</p>
    <p>Between late night deadlines, awkward almost dates and a viral kiss cam that makes them the city’s favorite “secret couple,” Emma and Nolan find themselves caught in something that feels a lot like fate. And Ruby, the cat who sees everything, is determined to give them a nudge... or a shove.
</p>
    <p>In a city that thrives on ambition and appearances, Emma and Nolan must decide if love is worth the risk. Because sometimes the greatest fortune isn’t in boardrooms or bank accounts, it’s finding someone who feels like home.</p>
    <p>Perfect for fans of Laurie Gilmore, Abby Jimenez and Ali Hazelwood, <i>Irresistibly Yours</i> is a cozy billionaire boss romance full of witty banter, heartwarming moments and one very judgmental cat.</p>

    <p><b>A hockey star on thin ice. A pastry chef with no time for games. And one cat who thinks love is the sweetest game of all…</b></p>
    <p>Sophie Lane has a full plate and it’s usually covered in frosting. Between pre-dawn bakery shifts, custom cake orders and being Emma’s best friend since forever, romance is the last thing she’s got time for. But when she agrees to cat-sit Ruby, the neighborhood’s sassiest feline, her calm life collides with Crestbridge’s biggest local hero.</p>
    <p>Ryan Blackwood isn’t just a household name. He’s the Comets’ golden boy, the kind of athlete who makes the city cheer and the tabloids swoon. He’s also charming, reckless and completely unprepared for a woman who smells like sugar.</p>
    <p>Between flour fights, unexpected kisses and a viral charity event gone hilariously wrong, Sophie and Ryan’s chemistry burns hotter than a bakery oven. But when fame, distance and one tempting offer threaten to pull them apart, it’s up to Ruby and Ryan’s loyal husky, Sasha, to make sure love gets the final score.</p>
    <p>Perfect for fans of Abby Jimenez, Tessa Bailey and Ali Hazelwood, <i>Sassily Yours</i> is a swoony, heartwarming rom-com full of sharp banter, emotional depth and animal-fueled chaos.</p>
